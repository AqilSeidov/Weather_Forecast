To work with app a few libraries required....(If you face with any problem related to libraries just download and add jar files of libraries into your 'lib' file)

Lib List: 

1 -- > json.jar

2 --> gson.jar

3 --> okhttp.jar

(optional)

4 --> flatlaf.jar(to design UI)

I have used OpenWeatherMap API in my code. You have to create an account on that site to get your own API key. After getting your API key add the key here...
